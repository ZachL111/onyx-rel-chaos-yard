# onyx-rel-chaos-yard

`onyx-rel-chaos-yard` is a Solidity project for Reliability. It turns develop a Solidity command-oriented project for chaos scenarios with fixture event logs, golden state snapshots, and offline replay mode into a small local model with readable fixtures and a direct verification command.

## Reading Onyx Rel Chaos Yard

Start with the README, then open `metadata/project.json` to check the constants behind the examples. After that, `fixtures/cases.csv` shows the compact path and `examples/extended_cases.csv` gives a wider look at the same rule.

## Purpose

The repository exists to keep a technical idea small enough to reason about. The implementation avoids external dependencies where possible, then uses fixtures to make changes easy to review.

## Fixture Notes

`examples/extended_cases.csv` adds six named cases. I kept the names plain so failures are easy to read in a terminal: baseline, pressure, surge, degraded, recovery, and boundary.

## Design Sketch

The design is intentionally direct: parse or construct a signal, score it, classify it, and verify the expected branch. This makes the repository useful for studying reliability behavior without needing a service or database unless the language project itself is SQL. The Solidity project uses Foundry tests and pure contract functions so invariants are cheap to exercise.

## What It Does

- Models failure windows with deterministic scoring and explicit review decisions.
- Uses fixture data to keep retry budgets changes visible in code review.
- Includes extended examples for runbook checks, including `surge` and `degraded`.
- Documents recovery paths tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.

## Usage

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Verification

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Files Worth Reading

- `src`: primary implementation
- `test`: language test directory
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands
- `foundry.toml`: Foundry project configuration

## Next Directions

- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add a short report command that prints the score breakdown for a single scenario.
- Add malformed input fixtures so the failure path is as visible as the happy path.
- Add one more reliability fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.

## Limits

The scoring model is simple by design. More domain-specific behavior should be added through explicit adapters or extra fixture classes rather than hidden constants.

## Setup

Install Solidity and run the commands from the repository root. The project does not need credentials or a hosted service.
